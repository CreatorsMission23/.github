the Creator's mission number 23 for life on earth is now called sevenfalling.

seven falling for the seven deadly sins that must be eradicated from the face of the earth, as they have led us to the worst tragedy that mankind will ever face.

the seven deadly sins are: greed, gluttony, envy, lust, wrath, pride and, the worst per the Creator, is sloth.

sloth is not a messy house.  sloth according to Him is "knowing about something, having the ability to do something, and doing absolutely nothing especially when it leads to death of one or more."

sloth is the one that gets Him irate.

(if you're wondering--prince's 7 lyrics gave us the idea for the name... "all 7 and we'll watch them fall, they stand in the way of (the Creator's) love and we will smoke them all."
